# GitPro
The GitPro Challenge of Syntax Error 2020!

## Task 1
Fork this repo and clone it in your PC.  
Add your name and github username to the `GitProList.md` in the given example format.  
Commit your changes.

## Task 2
Commited to the main branch? Git happens.
Checkout `yourname_task` branch and push the changes.

## Task 3
Return to the main branch. Now your local main and your repo's main branch have diverged.
Time to reset the changes.
Remember: Git history is written by committers. 

## Task 4
Go to `yourname_task` branch and create another branch named `yourname_idea` from there.
Create a file, idea.md where you explain your idea. After you're done explaining your hack, it's time to commit again. But wait, your idea needs to be kept a secret, who knows it could become the next "big thing" ! See if you can make git ignore it. After you're done, push the changes again.

## Task 5
You are doing good and making lots of commits. But hey! wait. Don't you think it doesn't make much sense to enter your username and password each time on pushing a commit. Configure your git details with a special command to tell git who you are at once.

## Task 6
You realise that there was a typo in your earlier commit of a pull request. Update the pull request with another commit and merge it into a single commit with another useful git feature.
